On the Bible reading page, the user has the options to take notes, highlight verses, bookmark chapters and access to other features **(3)**.

**\* Note:-** [Bookmarks](./bookmarks) , [Highlights](./highlights) and [Notes](./notes) features require the user to Sign Up on VachanOnline.

Visit [Settings](./readBible#Settings) to learn more.

## Parallel Bible

To utilize the Parallel Bible feature and read multiple versions at the same time, the user can follow these steps:

Click on the **Parallel Bible** icon **(1)** located on the right menu to open the Parallel Bible view.

Use the version drop-down **(2)** to select the desired language and version for simultaneous viewing of the Bible in two languages.

When the Parallel Bible view opens, it will automatically synchronize the Bible book, chapter, and scroll position, if available.

If the user prefers to read from the Parallel Bible independently, they can disable this synchronization by clicking on the Parallel Scroll icon **(3)** located in the middle of the page.

The Parallel Scroll is disabled, if there is no book in the parallel pane and it shows a warning message once it is disabled.
